# netflix-chalenge

Hi.

This project is a little example how to use container box and wrapper box for create the Netflix homepage.
I used the owl-carousel for create the carousel slider. 

This project was a chalenge for the HTML Developer course from the wbsite Digital Inovation One(https://digitalinnovation.one/) from the module HTML. Digital Inovation One is a portuguese website who offer lost of course in Tecnology but all the content is write in portuguese. So if you knoe portuguese language so let's learn!(:

Have a look the results in https://netflix-chalenge.mariaamelia1.repl.co/
